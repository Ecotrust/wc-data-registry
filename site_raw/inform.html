				<h3>Informing ocean and coastal health decisions</h3>
				<div>
					<p>Threats including marine debris, sea-level rise, and ocean acidification will continue to affect ocean and coastal areas throughout the West Coast region. By tapping into the Data Catalog and providing tools to map spatial information, the West Coast Ocean Data Portal will ensure that issues of regional importance are informed by the best available science and technology. The Portal will provide information to allow ocean and coastal managers to make informed decisions to improve ocean health, promote coastal economies, prepare communities for rising seas, and help fishermen continue to provide delicious seafood.</p><br></br>
                    <p>Marine debris is a global, as well as regional issue important to the West Coast that the WCGA has worked to address through coordination activities and the development of the <a target="_blank" href="http://debris-db.westcoastoceans.org/">Marine Debris Database</a>. We are currently working with marine debris experts to develop data visualization and analysis tools to support the needs of the marine debris community on the West Coast. These needs involve visualizing the sources, sinks, and transport of marine debris in our coastal areas to monitor baseline debris accumulation, prioritize clean up activities, and provide quantifiable evidence to advocate for policy actions. This work should be completed by Summer 2014.
