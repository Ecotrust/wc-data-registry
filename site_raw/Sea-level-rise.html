                <h4>Tracking sea level rise policies and impacts</h4>

                <div>
                    <p>A <a href="http://www.nap.edu/catalog/13389/sea-level-rise-for-the-coasts-of-california-oregon-and-washington">National Academy of Sciences study</a> commissioned by the West Coast Ocean Partnership, found that the rate of sea level rise (SLR) along the parts the U.S West Coast is predicted to be greater than the global average due to regional factors such as ocean circulation, melting of ice sheets, and tectonic plate movement.  Natural flooding, erosion, and storm event patterns are likely to be exacerbated by sea level rise, leading to significant social, environmental, and economic impacts. Explore how some communities are adapting to these changing conditions.</p>

                <p class="MpLinkBlock--caption">Local Coastal Programs (LCPs) are basic planning tools used by local governments to guide development in the coastal zone. LCPs contain the ground rules for future development, protection of coastal resources, and adaptation measures for SLR in California's 76 coastal cities and counties. Currently, no local jurisdictions substantially address SLR in their LCPs but that is about to change. The Ocean Protection Council and Coastal Commission are partnering with local jurisdictions to fund SLR planning along much of the coast to compliment other efforts under way including the development of Local Hazard Mitigation Plans and SLR Vulnerability Assessments (not displayed). </p>
