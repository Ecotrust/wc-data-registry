                <div>
                    <p>Global sea level is rising at an increased rate and will continue to rise during this century. Regional factors such as ocean circulation, melting of ice sheets, and tectonic plate movement help determine the rate of sea level rise (SLR) which is predicted to be greater than the global average along some parts of the West Coast. When combined with extreme storm and tide events, SLR will negatively impact coastal ecosystems, coastal development, and public access.</p>
