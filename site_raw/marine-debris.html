                    <p>Threats including marine debris, sea-level rise, and ocean acidification will continue to affect ocean and coastal areas across the West Coast. Tapping into the West Coast's rich data resources and providing tools to visualize and map that information, the West Coast Ocean Data Portal helps ocean and coastal managers make sound decisions to improve ocean health. You can start exploring the issue of marine debris and the Portal will soon address other cross-boundary ocean health issues.</p>
