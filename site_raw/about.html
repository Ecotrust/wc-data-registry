				</div>

				<div>
					<p>The West Coast Ocean Data Portal is a project of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.westcoastoceans.org/">West Coast Governors Alliance on Ocean Health</a> (WCGA) to increase discovery and connectivity of ocean and coastal data and people to better inform regional resource management, policy development, and ocean planning. The Portal will inform priority West Coast ocean issues such as tracking sources and patterns of marine debris, adaptation to sea-level rise, understanding impacts of ocean acidification on our coasts.</p>

				<p>The Portal links existing data systems together to provide an easy to use gateway to discover ocean and coastal data. Coastal decision-makers, researchers, and stakeholders use the Portal to access data and decision-support tools they need to understand and address high-priority regional issues. The Portal will soon include tools to help coastal mangers track marine debris to help prioritize cleanups and advocate for policies to reduce the impact of trash on our beaches.</p>
