The boundary, also known as the \'geographic scope\', of the PMEP includes the estuarine and marine nearshore complex (PMEP focus area, coastal subregions, and nearshore marine waters) of the states of California, Oregon, and Washington. The seperate zones and area of focused interest are available as seperate boundary layers. </methdesc> </method> <procstep> <procdesc>This layer was originally derived by combining the below into a single boundary. Data was compiled and manipulated by Van C. Hare, GIS Manager, Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission. 1.Coastal Hydrologic Subregions in Washington, Oregon, and California (extracted from the National Watershed Boundary Dataset as of November, 2011). 2.The aquatic area offshore out to the 200m depth line, including all bay/estuary areas(Bathymetry from NMFS, 2005 Groundfish EFH EIS dataset.) 3.All tidal and subtidal waters within the 3-nautical mile boundary of the states of Washington, Oregon and California. The above areas were combined to define a single polygon boundary encompassing the partnership\'s entire area of interest or \'geographic scope\'. Note that a more narrowly defined \'focus area\' is depicted in a seperate layer.</procdesc> <procdate>Unknown</procdate> </procstep> <procstep> <procdesc>In 2013, the boundary dataset developed by Van C. Hare was reprojected into WGS_1984_Web_Mercator_Auiliary_Sphere projected coordinate system to create the official boundary. In addition, FGDC compliant metadata was developed.</procdesc> <procdate>2013</procdate> </procstep> </lineage> </dataqual> <spdoinfo> <direct>Vector</direct> </spdoinfo> <spref> <horizsys> <planar> <mapproj> <mapprojn>WGS 84 Pseudo Mercator (ESRI Full Name: WGS_84_Pseudo_Mercator)</mapprojn> <mercator> <stdparll>0.0</stdparll> <longcm>0.0</longcm> <feast>0.0</feast> <fnorth>0.0</fnorth> </mercator> </mapproj> <planci> <plance>coordinate pair</plance> <coordrep> <absres>0.6096</absres> <ordres>0.6096</ordres> </coordrep> <plandu>Meter</plandu> </planci> </planar> <geodetic> <horizdn>D_WGS_1984</horizdn> <ellips>WGS_1984</ellips> <semiaxis>6378137.0</semiaxis> <denflat>298.257223563</denflat> </geodetic> </horizsys> </spref> <eainfo> <detailed> <enttyp> <enttypl>Attribute table for the boundary dataset</enttypl> <enttypd>Associated tabular data describing the shape of the boundary dataset</enttypd> <enttypds>Producer defined</enttypds> </enttyp> <attr> <attrlabl>AreaSqMi</attrlabl> <attrdef>Area of the Pacific Marine and Estuarine Fish Habitat Partnership boundary</attrdef> <attrdefs>Producer Defined</attrdefs> <attrdomv> <rdom> <rdommin>119164.609688</rdommin> <rdommax>119164.609688</rdommax> <attrunit>Miles squared</attrunit> </rdom> </attrdomv> </attr> <attr> <attrlabl>Name</attrlabl> <attrdef>Name of the boundary</attrdef> <attrdefs>Producer Defined</attrdefs> <attrdomv> <udom>Name of the boundary</udom> </attrdomv> </attr> </detailed> </eainfo> <distinfo> <distrib> <cntinfo> <cntorgp> <cntorg>National Fish Habitat Partnership Science and Data Committee</cntorg> </cntorgp> <cntaddr> <addrtype>mailing and physical</addrtype> <address>Denver Federal Center Bldg. 810</address> <city>Denver</city> <state>Colorado</state> <postal>80225</postal> <country>USA</country> </cntaddr> <cntvoice>303.202.4594</cntvoice> <cntemail>aquaticgap@usgs.gov</cntemail> </cntinfo> </distrib> <distliab>The NFHP Data System has been established to house authoritative versions of the data generated under the auspices of the National Fish Habitat Action Plan.
