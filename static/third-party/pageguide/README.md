jQuery.PageGuide
Brought to you by [Sprint.ly](https://sprint.ly/)

jQuery.PageGuide is a [jQuery](http://jquery.com) plugin for building dynamic, interactive visual guides that help your users get familiar with all the features of your site, without the unsightly clutter of static help text.

It all began as a simple modification of the fantastic <span style="color:rgba(248,2,130,1)">Tracelytics</span> [pageguide.js](http://tracelytics.github.com/pageguide/), with intent to make it work as a true jQuery plugin. But while rewriting the code, more and more features kept creeping in, and now it's taken on a life of it's own.

You can dynamically load and unload user guides, fine-tune the positioning of each step, and define event handlers on all parts of the guide (including each step individually) to perform actions in concert with the presentation.
